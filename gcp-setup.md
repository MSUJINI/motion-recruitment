Step 1: Create a GCP Account
Visit the GCP Website:

Navigate to the Google Cloud Platform website.
Sign Up for an Account:

Click on the "Get started for free" button.
Sign in with your existing Google account or create a new one.
Identity Verification:

Provide your personal information and credit card details for verification purposes. You will not be charged until you exceed the free tier limits.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the signup process.
Activate the Free Trial:

You'll receive $300 in free credits to use over the next 90 days as part of the free trial. Accept the trial terms and activate your account.
Step 2: Set Up a Google Compute Engine (GCE) Instance
Log in to the GCP Console:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Sign in using your Google account credentials.
Select or Create a Project:

From the dashboard, you can either select an existing project or create a new one by clicking on the project dropdown.
Enable the Compute Engine API:

If necessary, enable the Compute Engine API by navigating to APIs and services, searching for "Compute Engine API," and enabling it.
Navigate to Compute Engine:

In the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the top-left corner), go to "Compute Engine" and select "VM instances."
Create a New VM Instance:

Click on the "Create" button to start setting up a new VM instance.
Configure the Basics:

Name: Give your instance a meaningful name.
Region and Zone: Select your preferred region and zone.
Machine Configuration: Choose a machine type (e.g., e2-micro for a small instance).
Choose an Operating System:

From the "Boot disk" section, select "Change" and choose the appropriate operating system (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu, or any other preferred OS).
Firewall Settings:

In the "Firewall" section, check the boxes to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic if required.
Create the Instance:

Review your settings and click "Create" to deploy the instance.
Step 3: Deploy a Sample Python Script
Connect to Your GCE Instance:

Once the instance is running, click the "SSH" button next to your instance in the Compute Engine management console to open an SSH terminal window.
Update and Install Python:

Update the package list:
sudo apt-get update
Install Python if it is not already installed:
sudo apt-get install python3
Create a Python Script:

Using a text editor like nano or vim, create a new Python file (e.g., add_numbers.py):
nano add_numbers.py
Write a script to add two numbers and print the result:
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(add(5, 3))
Save the file and exit the editor.
Run the Python Script:

Execute the script to ensure it works correctly:
python3 add_numbers.py
You should see the output of your script in the terminal.
Considerations for Optimisation and Competitive Programming
Use Automation Tools:
Automate the creation and setup of your GCE instance using Google Cloud Deployment Manager or Terraform for reproducibility and efficiency.
Security Best Practices:
Ensure firewall rules are narrowly defined to only allow necessary traffic.
Use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control permissions and access.
Cost Management:
Monitor your usage through the Google Cloud Console to avoid unexpected charges.
Take advantage of the free tier for eligible resources.
