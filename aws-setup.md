 here is a step-by-step approach to document the process of creating an AWS account, setting up a basic EC2 instance, and deploying a sample Python script that adds two numbers:

Step 1: Create an AWS Account
Visit the AWS Website:

Go to the AWS Management Console.
Sign Up for an Account:

Click on the "Create a Free Account" button.
Provide your email address and choose a password.
Enter your account name.
Personal Information:

Enter your contact information, including your name, address, and phone number.
Select the account type (Personal or Professional).
Payment Information:

Provide your credit card or payment information.
Note that some AWS uses are free within certain limits, but having a payment method on file is required.
Identity Verification:

Verify your identity via a phone call or SMS.
Support Plan Selection:

Choose a support plan (Basic support is free).
Complete the Signup:

Review all provided information and complete the signup process.
You will receive a confirmation email after the account is created.
Step 2: Set Up a Basic EC2 Instance
Log in to the AWS Management Console:

Use your credentials to log in to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard:

In the main AWS Management Console, type "EC2" in the search bar and select the EC2 service.
Launch an Instance:

Click on the "Launch Instance" button.
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):

Select an operating system for your instance (e.g., Amazon Linux 2 AMI - Free Tier eligible).
Choose an Instance Type:

Select the instance type (e.g., t2.micro - Free Tier eligible).
Configure Instance Details:

Configure the number of instances and network settings.
Accept the default settings for simplicity.
Add Storage:

Specify the storage size (default configuration is usually sufficient).
Add Tags:

Add tags to your instance for identification purposes (optional).
Configure Security Group:

Create a new security group, configure inbound rules to allow SSH (port 22) from your IP address for remote access, and HTTP (port 80) if necessary.
This is important to secure access to your instance.
Review and Launch:

Review the instance details and click "Launch".
Select an existing key pair or create a new one to securely SSH into your instance.
Download the key pair and keep it in a secure location.
Launch the Instance:

Click the "Launch Instances" button and wait for AWS to deploy the instance.
Step 3: Deploy a Sample Python Script
Connect to Your EC2 Instance:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Use the SSH command to connect to your instance. Ensure your key pair (e.g., .pem file) has appropriate permissions.
Example SSH command:
ssh -i /path/to/your-key-pair.pem ec2-user@<EC2-Instance-Public-DNS>
Install Python (if not already installed):

Update the package index.
Install Python using the appropriate package manager for your instance's operating system.
Create a Python Script:

Use a command-line text editor (like nano or vim) or an IDE to create a new Python file (e.g., add_numbers.py).
Write the Python code to add two numbers.
Run the Python Script:

Execute the script using the Python interpreter to ensure it works.
Considerations for Optimisation and Competitive Programming
Automate Setup with Scripts: For scaling and automation, consider using AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to automate the setup of the EC2 instance and deployment of scripts.
Security Best Practices: Ensure that security groups are correctly configured to allow only necessary traffic. Regularly update and patch the instance.
Instance Management: Monitor instance usage. Start and stop instances as needed to save costs.
Scripting and Automation: Automate repetitive tasks using scripts to reduce manual intervention and potential errors.
